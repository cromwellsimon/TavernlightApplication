Due to issues that I had with vcpkg not cooperating with my versions of CMake during my setup process of ForgottenServer and OTClient, I did not have time to finish Q5. I ended up needing to create a Docker container and 2 VMs before I was able to get it working.
The whole troubleshooting/setup process ended up taking the entire weekend, so I only had 1 day to answer these last 3 questions :/
I did, however, finish Q7 fully and Q6 for the most part (GPU acceleration with Hyper-V didn't work so I had to create the shader on my local machine in a different engine).

However, here was my general plan of attack for this:
- Looking through all of the spells in Tibia, Eternal Winter was the obvious choice of the spell to base this answer off of.
- After seeing here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2V5_dq2YZE a tool called the Tibia Spell Creator (download link here: https://otland.net/threads/spellcreator-a-graphical-spell-creation-enviroment.160371/), something along these lines seemed like the obvious route to go.
- However, the Lua API for OTClient/ForgottenServer are different from Tibia, so I'd need to account for that. The part that makes that a bit more difficult is the fact that in OTClient/ForgottenServer, the functionality for this seems to be partially declared in the client while the other part is declared in the server, presumably for anti-cheat purposes, so not only was there a mismatch in the API, there also seemed to be a mismatch in the way it was called altogether.
- So, if I needed to only change the client (I'm assuming it's the same spell but just with a different visual), then I'd need to find out where in the client itself the visual can be found. Besides, in Eternal Winter, it looks like the small tornados disappear first anyways. Whether that's a difference in the animation frames or an actual difference in the code, I'm not sure, but it looked like a solid lead.
- But, I could not find the animation data anywhere. I could change the actual effect by changing the ICETORNADO effect in ForgottenServer with another effect and I could change where the effect happened in spells.lua which was also in the server, so I needed to find where ICETORNADO could be found on the client specifically.
- OTClient supports many different client versions of Tibia (the Tibia.dat and Tibia.spr with Tibia.spr being the far larger file, the single largest file in the game). Mixed with the fact that different client versions change what the Eternal Winter spell looks like as seen here: https://tibia.fandom.com/wiki/Eternal_Winter and this image was nowhere to be found elsewhere, that leads me to believe that the actual asset for the ICETORNADO is found inside of Tibia.spr and somewhere in there would be where I could go to edit the base animation since, if that was the only difference between two versions but the animation change applied, then that seemed like my best shot.
- But, with only one day, I had to pick my battles and trying to delve into hex editors did not seem like a very efficient use of my very limited time remaining, so I ended up skipping this question unfortunately
